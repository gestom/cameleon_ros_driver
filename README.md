## ROS driver for John Deere tractor

This is work in progress.
 
The ROS driver consists of two binaries, where one runs on the robot and the other locally.
To make it work, do the following.

1. Create a workspace, clone this repo, catkin_make it and source devel/setup.bash.
1. Turn on the robot and connect to its Wifi (ESSID: CAMELEON040).
1. The robot IP is 172.43.50.193, so set your own IP manually.
1. Go to the cameleon_ros_driver folder.
1. Copy robot-local files to the robot: scp -r server devel@172.43.50.193:~/
1. Compile and run the robot server: ssh devel@172.43.50.193 'cd server;make;./server'
1. Run the ros node: roslaunch cameleon_ros_driver cameleon_driver.launch
